Educational games for kids while in quarantaine

Hi all,
I appreciate a lot of us here might not be at this stage of our lives (yet), but 
with the coronavirus confining us to hour homes, I now have a 4-year old at home 
that needs to be entertained and possibly educated. Found it really fun and easy 
to hook onto a few of his delights (seeing things he likes) the simplest of game 
mechanics tricking him into learning letters using Processing.

The first (PictureType_Word) was designed to enthuse my son (2yo at the time) 
to learn the alphabet and the concept of sequence. The game speaks every letter or 
number you type, and rewards a matching sequence of letters with a photo from the 
database.

The second (PictureType_Letter) lets MacOS speak a word, prompting the player to 
type the first letter of that word. If they get it right, they get rewarded by a 
picture of that word.
